## Report
In the followiing, I documented the process and status of the PacketWatcherApp-Project from this <a href="https://github.com/AK960/PacketWatcher_App.git">GitHub-Repo</a>. The goal was to design an Android Application that can send and receive TCP and UDP Packets. Additionally, I also used this Readme.md file to take personal notes on the topics that were subject of this project.

#### Directory structure  
The MainActivity.kt file lies under app/src/main/java/com/mobilkommunikation/project and calls on the package ./ui/screens which contains two files to render the screen. Within these files, the ./ui/components package is called which holds the elements that are contained inside of the scaffold, designed in the MainActivity. The package ./controllers contains the Kotlin files that hold the logical functions that implement the client and server functions. 

#### Layout Design
As said before, a Scaffold was designed which creates a topBar without further functionality and also a bottomBar that is used to switch tabs between the Client and Server View.
The Client-View contains a SegmentedControl field, that lets the user choose between the two protocols "TCP" and "UDP" to send a message to the server. The inputFields provide the interaction possibility to enter a message and the endpoint it is supposed to be send to. By interaction with the button below, the packet is transmitted and shall be shown in the outputField below. The Server-View works analogous. 

#### Logic
The interaction components provide the input options for the user to set up the desired connection. When interacting with the buttons to start a service, first the IP-Address and Portnumber are checked regarding validity. When the check fails, an error message is shown on the screen. On success, the values are passed to the intended handlers, which perform case distinctions and pass on the values to the designated functions. 

#### Status Quo
In the following Notes section, the status quo of the project is noted down, formulating futher to-dos and requirements. Also, the major bugs are listed as some notes regarding important variables and examplatory functions.  

## Notes
### States and important Variables
| Variable Name                | Description                                                       | Description                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `clientServerStateIndex`     | Client = 0, Server = 1                                            | Switching Tabs Client/ServerView                 |
| `selectedProtocolStateIndex` | TCP or UDP                                                        | Selecting Protocol in SegmentedControl           |
| `ipAddress`                  | Choosing IP Address to transmit to                                | Passing TextField input to transmission function |
| `portNumber`                 | Choosing connection endpoint                                      | Passing TextField input to transmission function |
| `tcpMessage`                 | Specifying message to transmit                                    | Passing TextField input to transmission function |
| `protocol`                   | Choosing transmission type, takes over selectedProtocolStateIndex | Passing TextField input to transmission function |

### Functions
#### Choosing Transmission Type based on State Variable
  - onProtocolSelected: (String) -> Unit
    - onProtocolSelected --> Name of the parameter, represents a function that is called later
    - (String) --> String is passed to the Lambda-Function, which contains selected protocol
      - Variable selectedProtocolStateIndex = it (it from if-statement) is passed ("TCP" or "UDP")
    - Unit --> Function does not return a value (synonym to void)
  - Function expects Lambda-Function as argument that passes some behavior/logic to the function
    - This is the term { selectedProtocolStateIndex = it }
      - it is the sole parameter of the function
    - Makes the function flexible: The logic for the selection of the protocol does not need to be defined but is rather passed to the code by the calling code
  - Function calls the function SegmentedControl and passes the Lambda-Function as parameter
    - SegmentedControl expects Lambda-Function as argument for onOptionSelected
    - The onClick-function in SegmentedControl calls the lambda function on the current option
    - Thus, the value from selectedProtocolStateIndex is updated to "UDP" when interaction with the UDP button

## To-Dos
### Must <!-- Critical, must be delivered for project success -->
- Implement Client Functions
- Implement Server Logic
- Output In- and Outstream of sockets in LogCat
- Output of communication endoint in LogCat
- Output Log Messages regarding Server Socket, especially bounded portnumber
- Outsourcing of socket.accept() off the main thread
- Timeout to close server socket if no request comes in 

### Should <!-- Important but less time critial, can be implemented later --> 
- Output In- and Outstream of sockets in output Field
- Change button content if server is running (state variable)
- Making outputFields scrollable
- Coping with screen rotation 

### Could <!-- Desirable but not critical -->
- Changing App Theme & Colors
- Adding ViewModels for app composition

## Bugs
- Not possible to interact with app running on android studio emulator
- Enabling scrollable content resulted in app breakdown

## Theory Notes
### Lambda Functions
Characteristics:
  - "Unit" represents an empty return value, like void
  - Lambda-Function can be passed to dictate the behavior of the higher order function
  - The value of the last expression is returned in the end
  - They do not have names and can be passed as values

Syntax: 
```sh
# overall: Gets two values and returns one
val operarion: (Type, Type) -> ReturnType = { param1, param2 -> someLogic }
# Lambda expression in general 
{ param1: Type, param2: Type -> return value }
# Examples:
val add: (Int, Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a + b } # Returns solution as int
val show: () -> Unit = { content -> Column ( ... ){ ... } }
public fun Scaffold(
  modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
  topBar: @Composable () -> Unit = {},
  (...)
  content: @Composable (paddingValues) -> Unit
) { innerPadding -> (...) } 
```

Notation:
Lambda functions can be passed to higher order functions as argument
```sh
fun functionName (
  onProtocolSelected: (String) -> Unit
) { someString -> 
    println(someString) 
}
# To call the function
onProtocolSelected { var = "someString" } 
# If a function only has one parameter it can be referenced by "it"
onProtocolSelected { var = it } 
```
If the Lambda-Function is the last argument of a function, the {} can be outside the argument block
```sh
listOf(1, 2, 3).forEach { println(it) }
# instead of
val list = listOf(1, 2, 3)
list.forEach(fun(item: int) {
  println(item)
}) 
```
The Lambda-Function can have default parameters
```sh
val greet: (String) -> Unit = { name -> println("Hello, $name!") }
greet("Max")
```
Last but not least a simple comparison to a regular function
```sh
# Normal
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
  return a + b
}
# Lambda
val add = { a: Int, b: Int -> a + b }
```

### States
Intro: Compose apps transform data into UI by calling composable functions. If the data 
changes, Compose re-executes the functions with the new data, creating an updated UI 
(recomposition). However, Compose does not track common variables and monitor its changes.
The functions "State" / "mutableStateOf" / "mutableIntStateOf" are interfaces that hold
values that are monitored by compose and trigger recompositions whenever their value changes. 

Remember: If such a value is defined within a composable, it is prone to unwanted recompositions.
When some other state-value changes, all state values would be reset. To preserve a state across
compositions, the mutable state can be remembered. The remember-function is used to guard a state
value against recomposition, so that it is not reset.
```sh 
@Compose
fun Function(...) {
  val myState = remember { mutableStateOf(false) } # accessing with "myState.value"
  ( ... )
}
# or:
fun Function(...) {
  # "by" -> accessing state with only "myState"
  # "mutableStateOf" -> state is remembered when rotating the screen
  var myState by rememberSavable { mutableStateOf(false) } 
  ( ... )
}
```
However, when calling the same composable from different parts of the screen, it will create different 
UI elements with their own version of the state - internal states can be thought of as private 
variables in a class.
User interactions with various interaction components can be dealt with using states.

State hoisting: The term refers to the principle that state values can be declared in parent functions
and passed on to child functions as lambda expression. To do so, action buttons like onClick() call
functions and pass a lambda phrase as parameter. This way, composable functions are more flexible and 
can better be reused for different views.
```sh 
@Composable
fun MyApp(modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
    var shouldShowOnboarding by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
    Surface(modifier) {
        if (shouldShowOnboarding) { # state is true, hence OnboardingScreen is shown
            # passing function that tells OnboardingScreen to set state to false when button is clicked 
            OnboardingScreen(onContinueClicked = { shouldShowOnboarding = false }) 
        } else {
            Greetings() # When state is set to false, Greetings are shown
        }
    }
}
@Composable
fun OnboardingScreen(
    onContinueClicked: () -> Unit, # Taking in state variable as lambda 
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    Column(
        modifier = modifier.fillMaxSize(),
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
        horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
    ) {
        Text("Welcome to the Basics Codelab!")
        Button(
            modifier = Modifier
                .padding(vertical = 24.dp),
            # onClick executes the lambda function and finally sets state value to false
            # new view is composed (@Compose tracks and remembers state variable)
            onClick = onContinueClicked 
        ) {
            Text("Continue")
        }
    }
}
```

### ViewModels
ViewModel is a class that exposes the state of the user interface and encapsulates the associated
logic. Its principal advantage is that it caches state and persists it through configuration changes. 
This means that your UI does not have to fetch data again when navigating between activities.

### Sockets
Sockets are connection endpoints which relay traffic between client- and server-processes. For that, they are identified by the combination of IP address and port number. 
#### Server Socket
To communicate with a server process, it must be possible to address it from the outside. Thus, it binds itself to a socket through which it can be accessed and listens for incoming connections. If it receives a connection it accepts it and blocks the process until the request comes in, reads it, processes it, and responds. Afterwards it waits for further requests until the clients closes the connection.
#### Client Socket
The client does not need a fixed port but rather is assigned a free one. It then connects to the server, transmitting its own connection details through which it can be reached again. After transmitting the request, it waits for the servers response and listens on the specified port. Receiving the response, it either sends another request of closes the connection.
